My implementation was base on ABAGAIL package and jython environment. So the newest ABAGAIL.jar and jython 2.7 needed to be installed. Also the location of the ABAGAIL.jar file needs to be specified in each script, in the sys.path.append command in first few lines of each scripts. After changing that, all my script can be ran like [jython ANN_back.py] to get the output to STDOUT and local log files.
